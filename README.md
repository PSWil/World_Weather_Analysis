# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview
For this project we were asked to perform some weather analysis by using weather API's, including Open Weather and Google Console. We did a variety of different analysis that includes creating a weather database, a vacation search that is customizable, and a vacation itinerary that can plot travel information on a map.

## Summary

1. Retrieve Weather Data

-generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes
-retrieve the nearest city
-perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap
-retrieve the current weather description for each city
-create a dataframe containing the updated weather data

2. Create a Travel Destinations Map

-use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences
-use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels
-show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers

3. Create a Travel Itinerary Map.

-use input statements to retrieve customer destination preferences
-use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen by customer
-create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary****
