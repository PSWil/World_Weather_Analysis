# World_Weather_Analysis
## Overview

For this project we were asked to perform some weather analysis by using weather API's, including Open Weather and Google Console. We did a variety of different analysis that includes creating a weather database, a vacation search that is customizable, and a vacation itinerary that can plot travel information on a map.

* Retrieve Weather Data
  * generate a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes
  * retrieve the nearest city
  * perform an API call with the OpenWeatherMap
  * retrieve the current weather description for each city
  * create a data frame containing the updated weather data

* Create a Travel Destinations Map
  * use input statements to retrieve customer weather preferences
  * use those preferences to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels
  * show those destinations on a marker layer map with pop-up markers

* Create a Travel Itinerary Map.
  * use input statements to retrieve customer destination preferences
  * use the Google Directions API to create a travel itinerary that shows the route between four cities chosen by customer
  * create a marker layer map with a pop-up marker for each city on the itinerary****

## Summary 
In this analysis we got many opportunities to get familiar with API's, which we used to retrieve large amounts of data. Once we were able to set up our API's we then parsed the data from JSON files with indexing and using 'try-except' so not to exceed data limits. After getting more adjusted to using API's the possibilities that they offer are quite apparent.
